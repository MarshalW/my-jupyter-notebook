The middlemen would then pass the money on to the smuggling gang immediately after a successful crossing.\nBut three people - including two who had been on the same boat as Sara - told us the smuggling gang they had dealt with was operating out of the Belgian port of Antwerp, a city known for its criminal networks and illegal drugs trade. They also agreed that the gang was led by a man nicknamed Jabal - \u201cThe Mountain\u201d in Arabic. Two of them had met Jabal in person.
