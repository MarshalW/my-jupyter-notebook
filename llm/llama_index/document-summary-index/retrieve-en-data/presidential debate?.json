    "content": "Coming into this debate, polling indicated that voters gave Trump better marks on the economy and immigration - two of the top issues for American voters.\nMeanwhile, the president was favoured on abortion, healthcare and the environment.\nThe winner of Thursday night\u2019s debate could well be the candidate who can best land memorable lines on areas of strength while defending his weaknesses.\nCan President Biden convince voters that he shares their concerns about a surge in immigration but has been stymied by Republicans in trying to deal with it? Will former president Trump find a way to convince voters another term in office won\u2019t lead to greater restrictions on abortion \u2013 particularly given that he appointed three Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn the federal right to the procedure?\nMr Biden has been trying for more than a year to convince the American public that the economy is better than they think it is. He\u2019ll have a chance to make that case again to an audience of tens of millions, but he\u2019ll have to do so in the face of what\u2019s sure to be withering attacks from his opponent, who is expected to focus on the soaring prices and high inflation that Americans have had to live with in recent years.\n\u201cWe know that Joe Biden is going to try to blame everything on President Trump,\u201d Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller told reporters on Tuesday.\nHe added: \u201cAmericans know the difference between the Trump economy, which was great, where everyone was doing better, and the Biden economy.\u201d",
