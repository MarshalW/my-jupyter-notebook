    "content": "We set out to find and speak to as many survivors from that April night as possible, meeting some in the informal migrant camps or hostels for asylum seekers near the coast in France. Most of them asked us not to use their names, not least because some were planning to make further attempts at crossing the Channel.\nA young Kuwaiti man, who had been next to Sara as she died and had phoned the French police to ask for help, successfully made it to the UK a few weeks later. We tracked him down to Essex.\nMany of the dozens of people who boarded the boat with Sara and her family knew nothing about those in charge of the operation. They had spoken only to relatively junior middlemen who can often be found outside the train stations in Calais or Boulogne, looking for potential clients.\nOnce a price had been agreed - and there was seldom much haggling - most people then went on to deposit funds electronically with intermediaries. They told us these were usually trusted businessmen, sometimes operating from barber's shops or grocery stores in places like Turkey, Paris or London. The middlemen would then pass the money on to the smuggling gang immediately after a successful crossing.\nBut three people - including two who had been on the same boat as Sara - told us the smuggling gang they had dealt with was operating out of the Belgian port of Antwerp, a city known for its criminal networks and illegal drugs trade. They also agreed that the gang was led by a man nicknamed Jabal - \u201cThe Mountain\u201d in Arabic. Two of them had met Jabal in person. One had spoken by phone.\nThe trail also took us further east to Berlin, where another source confirmed Jabal\u2019s identity and told us he had promised him a second crossing attempt, after a first one had gone wrong.\nAll our sources, by this point, were telling us that The Mountain was in Belgium, probably Antwerp.",
