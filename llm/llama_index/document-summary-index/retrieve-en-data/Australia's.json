Sometimes reality is even better than how it was imagined.\u201d\nWhen Campbell finished her final swim in front of a sold-out crowd in Brisbane last week, her teammates immediately entered her lane to embrace her in the water.\n\u201cThis is the end, and it's a perfect way to exit the pool,\" she said through tears.\nTributes have continued to flood in from some of the nation\u2019s most recognisable athletes and powerful sporting bodies.\n\u201cCate has really set up this for a lot of us women,\" the reigning freestyle world champion Mollie O'Callaghan said.\n\"She set the standards, and she's one of the most inspirational women, in and out of the water.\"",
