      "\n",
      "1. **Understanding Heat-Related Illnesses**: The texts explain that high temperatures can lead to an increased body temperature due to difficulty in cooling down, which might result in various stages of heat illness including mild symptoms like dizziness and fatigue, progressing to more severe conditions such as heat exhaustion or heatstroke.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Preventing Heatstroke**: Detailed guidance is provided on recognizing the signs of heatstroke (high body temperature accompanied by confusion, seizures, or loss of consciousness) and immediate steps to take when someone shows these symptoms, including removing clothing for better heat dissipation, using ice packs, and seeking medical help promptly.\n",

      "3. **Safe Outdoor Activities**: The texts suggest avoiding outdoor activities during peak heat hours (10 AM to 4 PM), choosing cooler times like early morning or late evening for exercise. They also recommend selecting shaded areas or indoor locations with good ventilation for workouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Appropriate Clothing and Gear**: Recommendations are made on wearing light, breathable clothing that allows sweat evaporation and using sunscreen to protect against UV rays. The texts caution against the use of \"fat-burning\" clothes like \"bodysuits\" which can lead to excessive heat retention.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Hydration Strategies**: Emphasis is placed on drinking enough water before, during, and after physical activities, especially when humidity levels are high. It's advised to consume fluids that contain electrolytes to replace what is lost through sweat.\n",
      "\n",
