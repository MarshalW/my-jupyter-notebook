    "content": "Many former opposition lawmakers and democracy campaigners have been jailed since 2020 under a controversial national security law that criminalised all forms of dissent. Depsite international condemnation, Beijing defends the law as essential for stability.\nIn the years since, patriotism has become a byword for China's growing control of the city. It\noverhauled Hong Kong's electoral system with a \"patriots' law\"\nthat barred those seen as \"unpatriotic\" from political office. More recently, it\nbanned what has effectively been the city's unofficial anthem\n, a protest song called Glory to Hong Kong, because of its \"seditious\" possibilities.\nThe city has also set up a government committee to help \"the new generation to really appreciate our Chinese culture, our Chinese history,\" Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee said.\nThe education bureau's latest efforts are seen as part of the same campaign.\nIn November last year, the bureau introduced a new subject which would require students as young as eight to start learning about the Beijing-enacted security law. It also covers \"Chinese culture\" and history that aligns with the Chinese Communist Party's vision.\n\"Students [should be] able to understand that Hong Kong has the advantage of enjoying strong support of the Motherland and being closely connected to the world, which helps them build up cultural confidence,\" read a circular published by the bureau in November.\nLast month, the bureau also\ncalled on parents to work with schools\nto \"help [their children] learn the importance of safeguarding national security and enhance their national identity and national pride\".",
